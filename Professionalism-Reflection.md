Reflection
Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?
Yes I have, in my university assignment where we had to work in the same team for the entire semester and all assignments were group assignments which meant you needed to have solid understanding and communication between each other. It was great teamwork as we helped each other out, understood each other and worked in way where everyones strengths and weaknesses were used to the fullest.

What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?
Having a positive tone when talking to others and being mindful of how the information may come across.

How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?
By ensuring that everyone is being included, everyone is contributing to discussions and no one is disengaged.

How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?
By planning before, completing any tasks given beforehand to discuss any issues with supervisors and having a list of questions ready to go.

What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?
Eagerly completing the work, putting in effort to deliver above and beyond the expectations and being open to new opportunities and tasks.

How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?
I would email them if I need ifnormation from them, if they are available in the office I will walk up to them ask if they are not busy. If the situation needs escalation I will call them.

What are some things you won't do?
I would not aimlessly call them about minor problems, and try solving them myself by researching, using AI tools or asking my co-workers.
