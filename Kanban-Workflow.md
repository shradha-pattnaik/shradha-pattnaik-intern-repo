Agile Workflows & Kanban

Research & Learn
How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?
A Kanban board works by visually displaying the current workflow, by dividing it into different stages using columns and then tasks are moved from column to column to indicate which stage they are currently on. It helps manages workflow as it visually represents which tasks are having progress and moving forward and which tasks need attention or need work on. As to which more attention can be given to higher priority tasks that haven't started yet.

What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent? (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)
The different columns represent the different stages of progress on the Kanban board. Common columns found across workplaces include Backlog, which means any pending tasks that haven't even started yet. The 'In progress' column has all tasks that are currently being address or worked on, the 'blocked' column has all tasks that cannot progress due to a hurdle, examples of any hurdles include waiting on a particular person/team, software crashing or time constraints. Then the 'done' column has all tasks that have been successfully completed. Other columns that could be present for specific teams are 'code review', 'testing', 'deployment', 'analysis' depending on each type of team for example developers, financial, analysts. 

How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?
Tasks are moved through the board by simply moving the task into the different columns, there could be a particular team member assigned in moving the tasks or it could also be the project manager. 

What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?
Limiting the WIP is beneficial as it encourages to work on one task or smaller sets of task at a time as opposed to multi-tasking, I believe this improves productivity allowing to get more tasks completed in an efficient manner. 


Reflection
How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
Kanban helps manage priorities and avoid overload by setting out which tasks are currently in progress and which tasks need to be worked on, this way the team can allocate time towards tasks that demand higher time and effort. Moreover, overload can also be limited by making sure all of the tasks aren't completed altogether rather completed in a staggered manner to avoid overloading leading to burnout.

How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
I can improve my workflow using Kanban principles by setting out which tasks are in progress, which tasks need to be started but haven't and which are completed. Visually representing it I believe will help me understand where every task is standing and where I need to allocate my time. 

Task
Check out Focus Bearâ€™s Kanban board and note how tasks are structured. (Hint: Look in GitHub Projects.)

Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly.

Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.
I currently don't follow a Kanban board but after conducting research and reflecting on it, I believe it's an extremely useful way to organise my tasks as to which I will be implementing this system to track my task too. One way I will improve it is by also adding deadlines and colour coding the tasks based on category and priority.
