Understanding Focus Bear’s Mission & Vision

Why do you think Focus Bear was created?
I believe Focus Bear was created to help those diagnosed with autism or ADHD to stay more focused on their tasks. Its features allow its
users to stay focused, disciplined and consistent with their habits and goals.

What problem is Focus Bear solving?
Focus Bear is helping solve problems of staying focused when completing simple tasks or daily habits by making the routine distraction free. It is addressing the problem of being distracted by various social media and entertainment apps while attempting to do the simplest tasks, thus introducing the feature of focus blocks.

Why do you think this mission is important?
I believe this mission is important as this problem is not only directed to those with ADHD or with autism, but mostly everyone. Especially
now when everyone is surrounded with multiple forms of devices, it leads to more distractions as to which this app will help target a
broader audience too.

How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?
Focus Bear’s work aligns with my personal values and interests as I believe this is a great initiative to tackle the common problem of lack
of concentration and focus when completing the simplest of tasks. I want to observe how my habits regarding my work transition over
time while using the Focus Bear app.

Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?
I do personally relate to some of the challenged that Focus Bear aims to solve as sometimes I feel quite distracted due to my phone and
find myself doom scrolling while sitting in front of my open computer trying to complete my work. I believe this is due to lack of motivation but also reduced concentration span, and not only me but many of my friends also experience the same due to spending excessive
hours online.

Do you know someone with ADHD or autism or even someone without a diagnosis who has struggled socially or to perform well at uni? How might Focus Bear help them?
I personally do not know anyone with diagnosed or undiagnosed ADHD or autism who has struggled socially or to perform well at Uni,
however I think Focus Bear aims to help them focus on their daily tasks in the form of little sprints, and then taking a break. By doing so, it will help them be more efficient and feel a sense of achievement when their tasks are completed.
