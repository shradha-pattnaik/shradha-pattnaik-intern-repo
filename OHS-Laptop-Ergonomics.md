What are the risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard?
The risks of not using an external monitor or keyboard is that staring at your laptop for long periods of time will put strain on your back and posture. Moreover it will also put a strain on eyes due to staring at a smaller screen as opposed to a larger screen, a monitor. 

What ergonomic equipment can improve posture when working on a laptop? 
- laptop stands which elevates the screen
- external keyboards
- monitor 
- mouse 
- ergonomic chairs

What adjustments should be made to monitor height, chair position, and desk setup for a healthier workspace?
The chair position should support the back and lower back to ensure there is no strain. The monitor and laptop height should be eye level so there is no strain on the neck. Moreover, the workspace should be kept neat and tidy.


What are some daily habits that reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use? (e.g., movement breaks, posture checks, eye strain reduction techniques)
- Taking constant break/going on walks during those breaks or just moving the body
- Having some fresh air
- Having energising food, e.g. fresh fruit, healthy snacks
- Wearing blue light glasses


Reflection
What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup?
I already have a monitor and laptop stand, however I will be doing more research about ergonomic chairs and will be investing one after learning about its benefits.

What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? Definitely sitting upright and maintaining my posture, as well as going out to take some fresh air between work sessions to make myself feel more fresh and energised. 

How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? 
I will remind myself using the Focus Bear app to schedule movement breaks and brain breaks. 

Task
Document at least one workspace change or habit adjustment you made.
One workspace change I just made was cleaning my entire workspace, wiping down al surfaces, my keyboard, monitor and laptop. This creates a peace in my mind and helps me be more productive.
