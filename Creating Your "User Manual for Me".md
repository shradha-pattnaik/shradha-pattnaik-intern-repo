Reflection
What do you need from teammates to do your best work? (e.g., direct communication, flexibility, detailed instructions, minimal interruptions)
I would need direct and detailed communication from my teammates and making sure they have a similar vision to me in terms of the end goal.

How do you prefer to communicate? (e.g., async messages, video calls, quick check-ins, long discussions)
I prefer to communicate through messages or quick calls which can be via mobile or video calls. Instances where long calls are needed I am also open to that.

What helps you stay focused and productive? (e.g., quiet workspace, deep work sessions, structured to-do lists, music)
Things that help me stay focused and productive is having a visual display of all the tasks that need to be completed and a deadline for them too which I set for myself, which helps me stay on track. As per breaks, depending on my work-flow I take breaks as necessary or needed, sometimes I can go 1-2 hours without one and sometimes I need to take breaks every 30minutes depending each day.

How do you like to give and receive feedback? (e.g., clear & direct, with positive reinforcement, written vs. verbal feedback)
I like to give and receive feedback privately, ideally it should be clear and direct so I know where to improve on. The feedback can either be written or verbal, whichever better suited for the feedback.

What are some quirks or things to know about your work style? (e.g., need time to process ideas, like to brainstorm out loud, prefer written instructions)
- Strive for clarity, I need things to be detailed and clear before I can start so I know how to tackle each task. I will go out of my way to make sure I do understand what is required.
- I do like to brainstorm on paper about any tasks
- I am pretty flexible to working style
