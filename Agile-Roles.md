How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?
In the Scrum framework as everyone has a role and dedicated tasks that need to be completed within the sprint, as it is more structured in the agile framework all roles have their designated tasks. Whereas in the Kanban as it is more of a flexible working style, the team manager will guide the others to work through their tasks but it won't be as restricted and confined like the Agile framework.

Reflection
What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?
My role is the finance and grants intern would be conducting financial research about the investors, grants and other prospects. My role contributes to the agile framework as it is definitely an ongoing role where after each task it should be checked by the stakeholders.

How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
My responsibilities and roles interact with other roles in team, as I would be in communication with the data insights team, understanding the constant data trends and using that information to steer the financial research.

Task
Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.
My roles fits into the agile team as it will help the management team understand where to allocate funds in, in which areas of the app needs more work in which I will find out after conversing with other team members. I will also be understanding in which areas can the grants be used efficiently. The information will help make and shape other decisions moving forward. I believe that my role doesn't require strict following of the agile framework as my role is not one of the key roles like a developer or designer I believe my role requires me to work along the framework rather than strictly abide by it.

Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.
Another role I would frequently collaborate with would be the quality assurance team, I would definitely converse with them regarding the testing of Focus Bear app and ask if extra funds are needed in certain domains. If so, I would conduct some financial research and speak with my team and supervisor to understand how the problems can be mitigated with the use of funds.
