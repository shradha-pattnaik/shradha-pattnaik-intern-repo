Research & Learn
What are the main Agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?
Daily Stand-ups - to give updates and share progress about work, discuss any problems or achievements. The purpose of this is to ensure effective communication between team members and update about any difficulties encountered.
Sprint Planning (Scrum) - Sets the sprint time and the tasks to be completed during this sprint. Purpose of this task is to make sure all the tasks are being completed within a timely manner to obtain feedback.
Retrospectives - Retrospectives help reflect on the team's process, discuss any successes and challenges. It is done to reflect progress and also helps the team undertake the feedback into the next sprints. A retrospective is normally done after a sprint is completed.
Backlog Refinement - keeps the backlog organised, updated and all tasks are top priority are prioritised and the working style is tailored too as well. The purpose of doing this is to make sure the team is on track.

How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?
Agile teams collaborate asynchronously across time zones by using various communication channels and organising via schedules to ensure there is clear communication and everyone is up to date. With the help of online platforms like Discord, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Jira helps mentor progress of tasks and all team members across time zones can edit their progress. Additionally, establishing clear expectations from each other helps in collaboration across time zones, another way to collaborate is making use of times when all parties are available and using that time to schedule high priority collaborative tasks and meetings. 

Reflection

Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?
For my role I think the most important ceremony is the retrospective, it will give me information about the what went right and wrong and its affects on the finances helping shape the direction of funds.


Task
Attend a stand-up meeting and observe how updates are shared.
I have attended a couple by now and the meetings are pretty quick and clear cut. Everyone shares what they re currently working on, any questions, any problems and all of that is discussed. It's also nice to learn about what others are working on too.

Participate in a retrospective or review past notes from one.
I reviewed past notes of a retrospective.
I observed that they included a list that had what they	liked, learned, lacked and longed for. I feel like that's a great way to keep track of what worked, what didn't and what else can be implemented next time onwards. There were also action items listed that needed to be done after the retrospective too. I am definitely eager in joining the next retrospective. 

Document one change you can make to improve your team collaboration.
As of now I haven't had an opportunity to collaborate with my team except for share updates with my supervisor. However, if I was working in a team I would definitely ensure there is efficient collaboration and everyone is working to adhered timeline and tasks to maintain progress.
