What AI tools are typically used for your role?
After conducting research, I found that the best suited AI tools used for financial services would be DataSnipper, it matches and validates documents reducing the time allocated for this task. Datarails is helpful to forecast any data, budget and also helpful for financial reporting. Lastly, Power BI by Microsoft allows financial teams to gain insights and generate summaries. These are a few of the most useful AI tools that are useful for a role of Finance and Grants intern.

What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?
The benefits of using AI in a professional setting is that it optimises all the tasks, if majority of the tasks can be completed or partly done by AI there is efficient use of time. It also reduces any chances of human error, and can be really beneficial to automate some processes across the workplace.

The risks of using AI in a professional setting include that sensitive information could be given to AI which could be leaked in a data leak or be used with malicious intent. Other risks include that it could completely take over tasks thus replacing many jobs resulting in increase of the unemployment rate and also pose risks to moral dilemmas.

What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?
Any confidential information including personal identification information, login details, bank details or any private information related to the company should never be entered into AI tools, because we as used do not know where this information could be stored and be used. Moreover, in case of a data leak that information could be widely spread and misused.

How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?
AI-generated can be cross checked and validating by conducting some personal research from different and trusted websites. Reading the content carefully and looking for errors as well.


Reflection
When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?
I believe that AI can be used for completing simple tasks such as generating summaries, re-checking content, getting rid of any inconsistencies or human errors. Your own skills should be used when generating ideas and boosting creativity, for personal learning and for problem-solving. I believe that over relying on AI may do more harm than good.

How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?
You can avoid over-reliance on AI by ensuring that it is only used for simple tasks and to speed up/optimise tasks that are simple but time-taking. Having a strict line between when AI should be used and when it shouldn't.

What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?
The biggest step to take to ensure data privacy is not inputting any sort of confidential information, or information if leaked could lead to negative consequences. It is vital to understand the precautions to take when using AI.


Task

Identify one task you can improve using an AI tool, and try it out.
One task that I can improve using AI would be collecting any information those with undiagnosed ADHD to help tailor strategies and raise awareness about the app. I used chatgpt to collect information and statistics about people living in Victoria, Australia who have undiagnosed ADHD and then asked to present it in a tabular format for easier readability.

Review the AI-generated output criticallyâ€”did it require editing or fact-checking?
After reviewing the AI generated content it did present all of the information and then provided the references it derived its content from. I did still have a look at the references provided to make sure they were credible. It does not require editing but I believe all content derived from AI should be fact-checked regardless.
