What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?
Agile project management includes an iterative approach where tasks are broken down into sprints and team delivers software at the end of each sprint. The agile method focuses on product increments, and customer collaboration too. Whereas the traditional project management occurs in a more linear way all of the activities are done in one go rather than iterative approach. The traditional project management doesn't have much customer involvement, not that flexible to changes as a detailed plan has to be followed.

What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?
The differences between Scrum and Kanban is that although they are both agile frameworks, Scrum is a more structured framework where everything is already predefines regarding the roles, events, sprint time and it is used when teams require a more structured workflow which is effective. Kanban is a Kanban board which has numerous columns which indicate which stage a particular task or project is currently at. It is a more continuous workflow and does not have much structure as opposed to Scrum. Kanban is normally used for teams with flexibility and delivering continuously.

Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?
I believe that Focus Bear leans more towards Kanban rather than Scrum as it allows for flexibility in the working style. Moreover it allows for visualisation of the workflow making it easier for the team to understand where we stand regarding the allocated tasks.


Reflection
What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?
The biggest benefits of Agile include the constant customer collaboration, this way the client feels part of the process and has a say in each step, less risk of not meeting requirements, continuous testing and feedback, more flexible than traditional management, improved collaboration. Though some challenges of Agile include is that continuous changes could lead to scope creep, it heavily relies on motivated individuals so it's important that all team members are on task and that due to the constant changes there could be challenges in documenting the process.

How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?
Agile principles can help improve my overall role and responsibilities as it will keep more motivated due to constant feedback I will be getting, improve my flexibility as I will have to be adhering to the requirements.


Task
Summarise the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.
The main differences between Scrum and Kanban include that Kanban is a more visual representation of the progress of the work. There is a board which displays the progress and all team members are able to refer to it. Whereas the Scrum is more the approach of handling tasks, it has defined scopes, roles and tasks.
